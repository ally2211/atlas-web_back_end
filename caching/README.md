## Caching
### Create a class BasicCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

### Task 0: Basic Dictionary.
 You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
This caching system doesn’t have limit
```python
def put(self, key, item):
```
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
```python
def get(self, key):
```
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.
### Task 1:  FIFO Caching
Create a class FIFOCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
You can overload def __init__(self): but don’t forget to call the parent init: super().__init__()
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
If the number of items in self.cache_data is higher that BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
you must discard the first item put in cache (FIFO algorithm)
you must print DISCARD: with the key discarded and following by a new line
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.

### Task 2:  LIFO Caching
Create a class LIFOCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
You can overload def __init__(self): but don’t forget to call the parent init: super().__init__()
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
If the number of items in self.cache_data is higher that BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
you must discard the last item put in cache (LIFO algorithm)
you must print DISCARD: with the key discarded and following by a new line
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.

### Task 3: LRU Caching (discard the least recently used item (LRU algorithm))
Create a class LRUCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
You can overload def __init__(self): but don’t forget to call the parent init: super().__init__()
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
If the number of items in self.cache_data is higher that BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
you must discard the least recently used item (LRU algorithm)
you must print DISCARD: with the key discarded and following by a new line
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.
